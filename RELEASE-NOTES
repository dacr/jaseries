Crosson David - crosson.david@gmail.com
------------------------------------------------------------------

 - TODO : namesFromFile, namesFromString, namesFromURL must detect CSV pivot format 
    (and then getting series names may be quite slower)
 - TODO : Source.fromFile doesn't close the file descriptor...
    (check https://github.com/jsuereth/scala-arm)
 - TODO : make filtering works as it should !
 - TODO : add ++

------------------------------------------------------------------
1.6.0 - 2012-05-13
 - source files enhancements
 - various enhancements
 - now statistics implementation is fully decoupled from cell types.
 - introducing a new abstract cell with a default statistics provider implementation
   (CellWithDefaultStatisticsProvider)
 - default ordering for all cell types.
 - Series.combine fixes :
   + duplicates times problem 
   + time ordering problem in some situations
   + more robust searchFirstGreaterOrEqual
 - StackedChart now internally "align" series times, using 0 as a default value for missing cells
 - add new test 'Ordering test' to fix a time order problem while merging series
 - sbt eclipse 2.1.2
 - commons-compress 1.5
 - scala-logging 1.0.1 
 - sbt assembly 0.8.8

------------------------------------------------------------------
1.5.0 - 2012-01-25
 
 - build.sbt cleanup
 - Refactoring (GenericChart, ChartFactory, ...)
 - Refactoring achieved to make series a true scala collection !
 - Very high performance jump
 - Cells hierarchy cleanup 
   => now using things correctly, good implicits usage. (for both cells & series)
 - Code cleanup
 - Removed compiler warnings
 
------------------------------------------------------------------
1.4.0 - 2012-11-15
 - csv features moved to fr.janalyse.series.csv new package
   In your code, if you're using either :
     - import jaseries._
     - import fr.janalyse.series._
   Then the change is totally transparent ; no impact.
 - moving csv test cases into a dedicated test source file : CSVTest.scala
 - svn cleanup & svnignore.txt file added, and taken into account with this command :
   "svn propset svn:ignore -F svnignore.txt . scripts onejar project src/main src/test/ onejar/project/"
 - CSV2Series now provides method to quickly get just series names contained inside a CSV file
   + CSV2Series object : namesFromFile, namesFromString, namesFromURL
 - FIX - For An empty CSV column we must get an empty series.
 - FIX - Trailing cell separator must not generate an empty series with an empty name
 - fr.janalyse.series.csv package object contains csv general tools :
   + align : align a list of Series on the given time model (using sampling of course)
 - Series relativeSync method added
 - CSV2Series extract refactoring => now support any kind of Cell and 
   on the fly sampling depending of the chosen cell type and time period
   => CSV2Series fromString, fromFile, fromURL are now polymophics, they now requires a Cell Type parameter <: CELL
 - Series rename(newName:String, newAlias:String) method added
 - Series rename(newName:String) behavior modified, now alias is set to newName
 
------------------------------------------------------------------
1.3.0 2012-09-06
 - "implicit format:CSVFormat" now correctly used
 - CSVFormat comes with a default implicit format.
 - CSVFormatHints class removed.
 - CSVFormat class and usage refactoring
 - Support for variable columns csv, example with this following csv file :
      date;             A
      20-03-2011 02:00; 2
      20-03-2011 03:00;
      20-03-2011 04:00; 8
      date;             A; B; C
      20-03-2011 05:00; 1; 2; 3
      20-03-2011 06:00; 2;  ; 5
      date;             C; D
      20-03-2011 07:00; 7; 0
 - apache commons 1.8.4 dependency added (for bzip2 implementation)
 - gzip, bzip2 compressed csv file now taken into account in fromFile and fromURL methods
 - some TimeModel refactoring + adding a new TimeModel implementation : TimeModelCustom
   But would require some refactoring, performance potential problem I think.
 - package series object added : provides helper functions
   + align : align some series together on common times they share (using a time normalizer)
 - now supports any order for series computation with numbers : "10 + s" or  "s + 10"
   (thanks to an implicit conversion defined in series package objet
 - more test cases
 - series now overrides equals & hashCode (series alias field is not taken into acount - alias is a user friendly series name).
 - series times and values methods return IndexedSeq collection instead of Iterable
 - scala 2.8.x support removed
 
------------------------------------------------------------------
1.2.0 2012-08-05
 - now using sbt 0.12
 - now using sbteclipse 2.1.0
 - now using sbt-assembly 0.8.3
 - now using scalatest 1.8
 - Series factories enhancements
 - showLegend boolean added to chartConfig.
 - Add support for QuoteCell (for stock series processing)
 - Various Code cleanup and enhancements.
 - Add date automatic support for google finance historical data (although the API will be shutdown ~ october 2012) 
 - CSV2Series now supports direct parsing of Quote Series ( CSV2Series.quoteFromURL )
 - Automatic supports of CSV with all cells in quotes
 - new tests cases (quotes)
 - duration based takeRight and dropRight method added
 - chart classes refactoring
 - stacked chart type added : StackedChart class
   => BUT still work in progress as TableXYDataSet implies the same number of cells in each series !!! 
 - Series sample method now preserves cell type !! (was previously returning a StatCell!!) 
 - statSample method added to Series to allow sampling using StatCell
 - toSeries method added to Series to allow cell type conversions
 - Series count2Rate method renamed to toRate


------------------------------------------------------------------
1.1.1
 - Exceptions during CSV parsing do not generate failure anymore, it just breaks the parsing loop and print a warning.
 - Added a new example script: stockquery.scala 
 - updated for scala 2.9.2 support
 - scalatest 1.7.2


------------------------------------------------------------------
1.1.0
 - Statistics : alive added = OpenCell.time - CloseCell.time = series alive period of time
 - realias() without any argument means take the name as the alias.
 - added braces to delta, compact, zeroBased 
 - Chart seriesScales method renamed to scales
 - Chart new method : colors which returns a map of [Series[Cell], Color]
 - Added a package object jaseries to define shortcuts to 
   fr.janalyse.series.CSV2Series, fr.janalyse.series.view.Chart classes and objects


------------------------------------------------------------------
1.0.5
 - added count2Rate method to Series : Compute the series data rate from current series using optional periodicity (1s by default = 1000L)
 - updated sbt eclipse plugin to 2.0.0 release
 - updated sbt assembly plugin to 0.7.3 release
 - fix a big performance problem with 90 percentile computation in Statistics class
